		<h1>WHAT ARE YOU<br> LOOKING FOR<br> IN A TV?</h1>

		<h1>Screen Size</h1>
		<p>In most cases, size is the biggest factor when selecting a TV. To select a screen size, you might want to consider the number of people that would watch the TV at a given time, where you are going to place the TV, and then pick the largest screen size that will fill the available space without going over budget. The most popular TV size today, considering price, performance and the space available in the typical living room, is between 50 and 65 inches.</p>

		<h1>Calculating the best size of tv for your room</h1>
		<p>Consider the room in which the TV will sit. Measure the distance (in inches) between where you plan to mount the TV and where you plan to sit. To calculate the best size TV for your room, measure your viewing distance (in feet) and multiply that by 7.7.  So if you have a 42-inch TV, you can sit 84 inches (7 feet) away for a comfortable and immersive experience. If you're looking at a 4K ultra-high-definition television, the formula changes a bit. Because of the increased resolution, the recommended viewing distance is between 1 and 1.5 times the screen size. So if you buy a 50-inch TV, it would need to be placed between 50 to 75 inches away from where you’d sit.</p>

		<h3>Screen Resolutio: 4K or HD</h3>
		<p>The resolution of a television is the number of pixels in each dimension that the TV can display natively. A pixel is essentially a lit-up square that produces a specific color. The more pixels you have on a TV, the more detailed the picture on the screen will appear. The sharpness of the TV here is usually in terms of horizontal lines of pixels. </p>
